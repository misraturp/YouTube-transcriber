# YouTube-transcriber

Let's build an interactive web app that can transcribe YouTube videos in minutes! Streamlit is a great Python library that makes web development a piece of cake. And on top of Streamlit's powerful framework we will plug in Assembly AI's easy-to-use API to quickly upload and transcribe audio files.

For this project you need 3 libraries on top of Python:
* Streamlit (pip install streamlit)
* Youtube_dl (pip install youtube_dl)
* FFmpeg ([download here](https://ffbinaries.com/downloads))

These libraries will enable us to create a front-end for our project, download youtube videos and extract audio files from youtube videos respectively.
